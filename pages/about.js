        <p className="font-bold text-3xl text-blue-900">A MEAN stack devloper who is constantly diving into new techonology and tries their best to find the next cool thing. My favorite thing about development is finding new things and mashing them together until I can get them to work. </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-3xl text-blue-900">I currently work for Bitwise Industries as a MEAN stack apprentice. This opportunity has allowed me to work under a lead developer and learn as much as possible. I feel like I&apos;ve learned a lot in my time with this company and I&apos;m ready to branch away and see what&apos;s out there.</p>
